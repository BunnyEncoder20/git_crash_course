# Hello Git

- Though I've a pretty good idea about git after making so many projects and always using git for version control, it's always good to keep myself updated and revisit base concepts.
- This repo is just for revision crash course I'm doing for git.
- This will help me revise my basics of git and also dive deeper into advance concepts of version controlling.
